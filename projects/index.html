<h3 id="1-read-this-first">1. Read this first</h3>
<p>If you contact me and it is obvious from your e-mail that you did not read this page, I <b>will</b> ignore your request.</p>
<p>Because 2020 was a dumpster fire of a year, and the world does not seem to be going in an upward direction, I am progressively shifting my focus to supervising projects <b><u>for social good</u></b>, i.e. projects which have a net positive or at least a net neutral ethical footprint. What that means in practice for you as a potential student, is that I will not supervise the following types of projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stock price prediction projects (boring) ;</li>
<li>Optimising financial something-something (gross) ;</li>
<li>Modelling COVID-19 (leave that to the epidemiologists).</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, I am particularly interested in projects which bring a net positive to the world, such as helping stop the spread of fake news, propaganda and hate speech online, or software to help mental health professionals, etc.</p>
<h3 id="2-proposing-your-own-idea">2. Proposing your own idea</h3>
<p>If you want to propose your own idea, which you think fits in my overall themes (or is just so cool you might just convert me), I am giving you an easy 7 step format to structure your idea into a good project. This is not the only way to do things well, but it is a way that does things well consistently, and therefore I am more comfortable in sharing it. The goal is to structure your idea in a way that helps you structure your actual project. At the start you should be confident in your understanding of point 1 and 2, and work your way into answering the rest of the questions.</p>
<p><b>Step 1.</b> There is a problem in the world:</p>
<p><b>Step 2.</b> That problem is important because:</p>
<p><b>Step 3.</b> A cursory search shows me other people who tried to fix this problem:</p>
<p><b>Step 4.</b> A better way to solve it would be to do:</p>
<p><b>Step 5.</b> 
<ul>
<li>(If research emphasis) this raises the following research questions:</li>
<li>(If engineering emphasis) this raises the following feature requirements:</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Step 6.</b>
<ul>
<li>(If research emphasis) I will solve those research questions by performing the following experiments:</li>
<li>(If engineering emphasis) I will solve those requirements by implementing the following software:</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Step 7.</b>
<ul>
<li>(If research emphasis) I will validate my hypothesis based on the following baselines:</li>
<li>(If engineering emphasis) I will validate my requirements as follows:</li>
</ul></p>
<h3 id="projects-1">Projects</h3>
<p>All projects are initial idea blurbs - they are negotiable and should be discussed.</p>
<h4 id="1-a-filter-bubble-for-trusted-news-semi-automated-social-fact-checking">1. A Filter Bubble for Trusted News: Semi-Automated Social Fact-Checking</h4>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: software engineering</p>
<p>In this project you will build a browser plug-in which lets users label and annotate news articles with evidence of their veracity, or lack thereof. The system will also let users register accounts and assess other users as trustworthy or untrustworthy. This labelling will allow the system to propagate trustworthiness metrics along the graph of users, based on some existing graph algorithms in abstract argumentation theory.</p>
<h4 id="2-a-searching-storage-and-annotation-engine-for-researchers">2. A Searching, Storage and Annotation Engine for Researchers</h4>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: software engineering</p>
<p>You will use the <a href="https://core.ac.uk/services/api/">CORE API</a> in order to build a search engine client that lets the user annotate articles and create a personal database. The search engine client will let the user add a paper to their personal collection, which will download them into an offline document collection where the paper will be indexed, along with their annotation, for further use.</p>
<h4 id="3-an-interpretable-active-learning-based-dialogue-labeling-application">3. An Interpretable Active-Learning Based Dialogue Labeling Application</h4>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: research and software engineering</p>
<p>Creating a good dataset is one of the major pain points when investigating new venues in machine learning. One of the reasons for this is that labelling data is difficult and time-consuming, and software designed to ease that process is scarce and expensive. This project aims at producing an open source alternative to those solutions, where the designer of the experiment can configure a hosted personalised labelling software in a couple of hours. The application would then allow authorised users to log in a Web interface, and be presented with a sequence of random examples that they can label, which is where the research part of the project is. The goal of the project is to apply active learning and interpretable classification in order to produce an online software that allows people to label turn-by-turn dialogues with a generic set of classes.</p>
<h4 id="4-a-cross-lingual-approach-to-fake-news-classification">4. A Cross-Lingual Approach to Fake News Classification</h4>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: research</p>
<p>In this project, you will investigate fake news classification in a new angle by asking the following fundamental question: can we use data in multiple languages to enhance the performance of a fake news classifier?</p>
<h4 id="5-a-news-aggregator-and-analyser-to-follow-the-evolution-of-public-sentiment-through-time-and-space">5. A news aggregator and analyser to follow the evolution of public sentiment through time and space</h4>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: software engineering</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This project will be supervised by me, and co-supervised by Elena Nichele</p>
<p>In this project you will build an application that will track, download and aggregate news about a specific set of topics in a pre-specified set of British newspapers. This application will provide a dashboard that allows the user to track the subtopics being discussed as well as the overall sentiment expressed in the news articles based on time (publication date) and space (allowing the user to specify a location for each news outlet). It will be evaluated by real linguists and scientists and might end up being part of a larger project, and a potential scientific publication, to which you will have the option to take part in (provided the project is successful).</p>
<h4 id="6-a-dashboard-for-collocation-analysis-in-large-datasets">6. A dashboard for collocation analysis in large datasets</h4>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: software engineering</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This project will be supervised by Elena Nichele and co-supervised by me</p>
<p>Non-native speakers of English are very likely to struggle with word order and semantic shades, i.e. selecting the most suitable word for a given context. This problem affects speakers at all levels of proficiency and is particularly important to achieve a native-like command of the language. In this project you will build a messaging application to enhance language learning by tracking collocates over time. The application should allow a language learner to communicate with a native speaker and compare the use of collocates over time in order to see whether the learner is improving (the learner progressively models the native and their use becomes increasingly similar to that of the native speaker), stable (their use does not change) or getting worse (the learner does not absorb from the native and their use remains distinguishable from the one from the native speaker). The application should then display regular feedback in the form of a traffic light system (green/orange/red, or some colourblind-accessible variation) so that the learner knows whether they are going in the right direction, and a plot to visualise their progress over time. Finally, it should point out specific examples that determined the outcome, so that the non-native speaker could learn from their own mistakes or inaccuracies.</p>
