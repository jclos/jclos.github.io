<h3 id="1-read-this-first">1. Read this first</h3>
<p>If you contact me and it is obvious from your e-mail that you did not read this page, I <b>will</b> ignore your request.</p>
<p>Because 2020 and 2021 were a dumpster fire, and the world does not seem to be going in an upward direction, I am progressively shifting my focus to supervising projects <b><u>for social good</u></b>, i.e. projects which have a net positive or at the very minimum a net neutral ethical footprint. What that means in practice for you as a potential student, is that I will not supervise the following types of projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stock price prediction projects (boring) ;</li>
<li>Optimising financial something-something (gross) ;</li>
<li>Modelling COVID-19 (leave that to the epidemiologists).</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, I am particularly interested in projects which bring a net positive to the world, such as tackling disinformation/misinformation, helping mental health professionals, or anything related to text and language. I may be convinced to supervise something outside of my area of expertise if it is incredibly cool (e.g., building a VR game) but keep in mind that lacking any expertise in it, my assistance will be limited to general project management and writing/reading.</p>
<h3 id="2-proposing-your-own-idea">2. Proposing your own idea</h3>
<p>If you want to propose your own idea, which you think fits in my overall themes (or is just so cool you might just convert me), I am giving you an easy 7 step format to structure your idea into a decent project. This is not the only way to do things well, but it is a way that does things well consistently, and therefore I am more comfortable in sharing it. The goal is to structure your idea in a way that helps you structure your actual project. At the start you should be confident in your understanding of point 1 and 2, and work your way into answering the rest of the questions.</p>
<p><b>Step 1.</b> There is a problem in the world:</p>
<p><b>Step 2.</b> That problem is important because:</p>
<p><b>Step 3.</b> A cursory search shows me other people who tried to fix this problem:</p>
<p><b>Step 4.</b> A better way to solve it would be to do:</p>
<p><b>Step 5.</b> 
<ul>
<li>(If research emphasis) this raises the following research questions:</li>
<li>(If engineering emphasis) this raises the following feature requirements:</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Step 6.</b>
<ul>
<li>(If research emphasis) I will solve those research questions by performing the following experiments:</li>
<li>(If engineering emphasis) I will solve those requirements by implementing the following software:</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Step 7.</b>
<ul>
<li>(If research emphasis) I will validate my hypothesis based on the following baselines:</li>
<li>(If engineering emphasis) I will validate my requirements as follows:</li>
</ul></p>
<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
<p>Projects are usually idea blurbs, meaning that they are negotiable and can be discussed to reduce/expand scope or propose alternative ways of solving them. Successful projects will potentially lead to publications to which the student can take part in after submission of the dissertation. It is very rare that projects deemed publishable get a grade under 80%.</p>
<h4 id="1-open-investigation-detecting-misinformationdisinformation">1. [Open investigation] Detecting misinformation/disinformation</h4>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: research</p>
<p>In this project, you will investigate the detection of misinformation in a novel angle by asking a fundamental question such as: can we use data in multiple languages to enhance the performance of a fake news classifier? This is a very general topic and I expect you to come talk to me with your take on it (your take may or may not be cross-lingual in nature). Keep in mind that the space of potential research questions is bound by the availability of public data, and your capacity to acquire it.</p>
<h4 id="2-applied-an-application-for-automated-time-segmentation-of-text-corpora">2. [Applied] An application for automated time segmentation of text corpora</h4>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: research and software engineering</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This project will be supervised by me, and co-supervised by <strong>Dr Emma McClaughlin</strong></p>
<p>Analysing language change over time is a common challenge in corpus linguistics. In this project, you will build an application (either web-based or desktop) that can analyse a dataset of timestamped text documents and map trending topics based on multiple methods (bursty ngrams, topic modelling) in order to allow for the segmentation of the dataset in contiguous time segments. As part of the project you will have to investigate and define appropriate trend detection methods, build the application, and validate the application with a small case study.</p>
<h4 id="3-applied-the-news-wall">3. [Applied] The News Wall</h4>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: data engineering</p>
<p>The goals of this project are two-fold: (1) You will produce a comparative study of lightweight active learning models for the detection of misinformation in news and social media text. (2) You will build a modern Web application plugged in a social media news feed which classifies the news using a relevant set of categories (e.g., probably true, unsure, probably untrue, satire). This application will allow users to click on the news item to see an excerpt of the text content as well as a series of characteristics such as main topics, sentiment, likelihood of misinformation. It will also allow registered users to correct the information by supplying their own.</p>
<h4 id="4-open-investigation-code-mixed-text-classification-in-the-languages-of-malaysia">4. [Open investigation] Code-mixed text classification in the languages of Malaysia</h4>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: research</p>
<p>Code-mixing is the mixing of vocabulary and syntax of multiple languages in the same sentence. It is a common practice in multi-cultural countries such as Malaysia, and there is relatively little research on the building of effective language and classification models in a code-mixed context. In this project you will investigate code-mixed text classification in a Malaysian context. You will find datasets representative of common code-mixed text (e.g., Malay-English, English-Malay, Chinese-English, English-Chinese)</p>
<h4 id="5-applied-an-optimisation-tool-for-lab-assistant-allocation">5. [Applied] An Optimisation Tool for Lab Assistant Allocation</h4>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: software engineering</p>
<p>Each term starts with the long and arduous process in which the person responsible for Lab Assistant Allocation painstakingly assigns each postgraduate research student and teaching assistant/associate to an appropriate number of modules, based on their time commitment, skills, and existing schedule. The goal of this project is to partially automate this process by building a Web application which can take as input a list of lab assistants and roles (TA, PGR, post-doc) and skills, and a list of modules with time commitment, required skills, and number of students, and interactively propose allocations to the Lab Assistant Allocator.</p>
<h4 id="6-applied-a-transcription-software-for-gdpr-compliant-qualitative-researchers">6. [Applied] A transcription software for GDPR-compliant qualitative researchers</h4>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: software engineering</p>
<p>Regulations on privacy force qualitative researchers as well as therapists to rely on transcribers to turn their recorded interviews into usable text ready to be coded, due to the automated solutions not being GDPR-compliant. In this project you will build an application that uses an offline voice-to-text model such as DeepSpeech to help those researchers in quickly transcribing their interviews. The system will allow for the (1) import of a model as well as its (2) finetuning to the researcher&rsquo;s voice by allowing them to read a specified text aloud, and offer a review mode to fix the model&rsquo;s mistakes.</p>
