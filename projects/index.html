<h3 id="1-read-this-first">1. Read this first</h3>
<p>If you contact me and it is obvious from your e-mail that you did not read this page, I <b>will</b> ignore your request.</p>
<p>Because 2020 and 2021 were a dumpster fire, and the world does not seem to be going in an upward direction, I am progressively shifting my focus to supervising projects <b><u>for social good</u></b>, i.e. projects which have a net positive or at the very minimum a net neutral ethical footprint. What that means in practice for you as a potential student, is that I will not supervise the following types of projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stock price prediction projects (boring) ;</li>
<li>Optimising financial something-something (gross) ;</li>
<li>Modelling COVID-19 (leave that to the epidemiologists).</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, I am particularly interested in projects which bring a net positive to the world, such as tackling disinformation/misinformation, helping mental health professionals, or anything related to text and language. I may be convinced to supervise something outside of my area of expertise if it is incredibly cool (e.g., building a VR game) but keep in mind that lacking any expertise in it, my assistance will be limited to general project management and writing/reading.</p>
<h3 id="2-proposing-your-own-idea">2. Proposing your own idea</h3>
<p>If you want to propose your own idea, which you think fits in my overall themes (or is just so cool you might just convert me), I am giving you an easy 7 step format to structure your idea into a decent project. This is not the only way to do things well, but it is a way that does things well consistently, and therefore I am more comfortable in sharing it. The goal is to structure your idea in a way that helps you structure your actual project. At the start you should be confident in your understanding of point 1 and 2, and work your way into answering the rest of the questions.</p>
<p><b>Step 1.</b> There is a problem in the world:</p>
<p><b>Step 2.</b> That problem is important because:</p>
<p><b>Step 3.</b> A cursory search shows me other people who tried to fix this problem:</p>
<p><b>Step 4.</b> A better way to solve it would be to do:</p>
<p><b>Step 5.</b> 
<ul>
<li>(If research emphasis) this raises the following research questions:</li>
<li>(If engineering emphasis) this raises the following feature requirements:</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Step 6.</b>
<ul>
<li>(If research emphasis) I will solve those research questions by performing the following experiments:</li>
<li>(If engineering emphasis) I will solve those requirements by implementing the following software:</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Step 7.</b>
<ul>
<li>(If research emphasis) I will validate my hypothesis based on the following baselines:</li>
<li>(If engineering emphasis) I will validate my requirements as follows:</li>
</ul></p>
<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
<p>Projects are usually idea blurbs, meaning that they are negotiable and can be discussed to reduce/expand scope or propose alternative ways of solving them. Successful projects will potentially lead to publications to which the student can take part in after submission of the dissertation. It is very rare that projects deemed publishable get a grade under 80%.</p>
<h4 id="1-open-investigation-detecting-misinformationdisinformation">1. [Open investigation] Detecting misinformation/disinformation</h4>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: research</p>
<p>In this project, you will investigate the detection of misinformation in a novel angle by asking a fundamental question such as: can we use data in multiple languages to enhance the performance of a fake news classifier? This is a very general topic and I expect you to come talk to me with your take on it (your take may or may not be cross-lingual in nature). Keep in mind that the space of potential research questions is bound by the availability of public data, and your capacity to acquire it.</p>
<h4 id="2-applied-an-application-for-automated-time-segmentation-of-text-corpora">2. [Applied] An application for automated time segmentation of text corpora</h4>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: research and software engineering</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This project will be supervised by me, and co-supervised by <strong>Dr Emma McClaughlin</strong></p>
<p>Analysing language change over time is a common challenge in corpus linguistics. In this project, you will build an application (either web-based or desktop) that can analyse a dataset of timestamped text documents and map trending topics based on multiple methods (bursty ngrams, topic modelling) in order to allow for the segmentation of the dataset in contiguous time segments. As part of the project you will have to investigate and define appropriate trend detection methods, build the application, and validate the application with a small case study.</p>
<h4 id="3-applied-a-news-aggregator-and-analyser-to-track-public-sentiment">3. [Applied] A News Aggregator and Analyser to Track Public Sentiment</h4>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: software engineering</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This project will be supervised by me, and co-supervised by <strong>Dr Elena Nichele</strong></p>
<p>In this project you will build an application that will track, download and aggregate news about a specific set of topics in a pre-specified set of British newspapers. This application will provide a dashboard that allows the user to track the subtopics being discussed as well as the overall sentiment expressed in the news articles based on time (publication date) and space (allowing the user to specify a location for each news outlet). It will be evaluated by real linguists and scientists and might end up being part of a larger project.</p>
<h4 id="4-applied-a-linguistics-driven-application-for-language-learning">4. [Applied] A Linguistics-Driven Application for Language Learning</h4>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: software engineering</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This project will be supervised by <strong>Dr Elena Nichele</strong> and co-supervised by me</p>
<p>Non-native speakers of English are very likely to struggle with word order and semantic shades, i.e. selecting the most suitable word for a given context. This problem affects speakers at all levels of proficiency and is particularly important to achieve a native-like command of the language. In this project you will build a messaging application to enhance language learning by tracking collocates over time. The application should allow a language learner to communicate with a native speaker and compare the use of collocates over time in order to see whether the learner is improving (the learner progressively models the native and their use becomes increasingly similar to that of the native speaker), stable (their use does not change) or getting worse (the learner does not absorb from the native and their use remains distinguishable from the one from the native speaker). The application should then display regular feedback in the form of a traffic light system (green/orange/red, or some colourblind-accessible variation) so that the learner knows whether they are going in the right direction, and a plot to visualise their progress over time. Finally, it should point out specific examples that determined the outcome, so that the non-native speaker could learn from their own mistakes or inaccuracies.</p>
