<h3 id="1-read-this-first">1. Read this first</h3>
<p>If you contact me and it is obvious from your e-mail that you did not read this page, I <b>will</b> ignore your request.</p>
<p>Because 2020 was a dumpster fire of a year, and the world does not seem to be going in an upward direction, I am progressively shifting my focus to supervising projects <b><u>for social good</u></b>, i.e. projects which have a net positive or at least a net neutral ethical footprint. What that means in practice for you as a potential student, is that I will not supervise the following types of projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stock price prediction projects (boring) ;</li>
<li>Optimising financial something-something (gross) ;</li>
<li>Modelling COVID-19 (leave that to the epidemiologists).</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, I am particularly interested in projects which bring a net positive to the world, such as helping stop the spread of fake news, propaganda and hate speech online, or software to help mental health professionals, etc.</p>
<h3 id="2-proposing-your-own-idea">2. Proposing your own idea</h3>
<p>If you want to propose your own idea, which you think fits in my overall themes (or is just so cool you might just convert me), I am giving you an easy 7 step format to structure your idea into a good project. This is not the only way to do things well, but it is a way that does things well consistently, and therefore I am more comfortable in sharing it. The goal is to structure your idea in a way that helps you structure your actual project. At the start you should be confident in your understanding of point 1 and 2, and work your way into answering the rest of the questions.</p>
<p><b>Step 1.</b> There is a problem in the world:</p>
<p><b>Step 2.</b> That problem is important because:</p>
<p><b>Step 3.</b> A cursory search shows me other people who tried to fix this problem:</p>
<p><b>Step 4.</b> A better way to solve it would be to do:</p>
<p><b>Step 5.</b> 
<ul>
<li>(If research emphasis) this raises the following research questions:</li>
<li>(If engineering emphasis) this raises the following feature requirements:</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Step 6.</b>
<ul>
<li>(If research emphasis) I will solve those research questions by performing the following experiments:</li>
<li>(If engineering emphasis) I will solve those requirements by implementing the following software:</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Step 7.</b>
<ul>
<li>(If research emphasis) I will validate my hypothesis based on the following baselines:</li>
<li>(If engineering emphasis) I will validate my requirements as follows:</li>
</ul></p>
<h3 id="3-final-year-projects">3. Final year projects</h3>
<h4 id="a-semi-automated-fact-checking-tool-for-online-news">A Semi-Automated Fact-Checking Tool for Online News</h4>
<p>Type: software engineering</p>
<p>In this project you will build a browser plug-in which lets users label and annotate news articles with evidence of their veracity, or lack thereof. The system will also let users register accounts and assess other users as trustworthy or untrustworthy. This labelling will allow the system to propagate trustworthiness metrics along the graph of users, based on some existing graph algorithms in abstract argumentation theory.</p>
<h4 id="a-storage-and-annotation-engine-for-researchers">A Storage and Annotation Engine for Researchers</h4>
<p>Type: software engineering</p>
<p>You will use the <a href="https://core.ac.uk/services/api/">CORE API</a> in order to build a search engine client that lets the user annotate articles and create a personal database. The search engine client will let the user add a paper to their personal collection, which will download them into an offline document collection where the paper will be indexed, along with their annotation, for further use.</p>
<h3 id="4-msc-projects">4. MSc projects</h3>
<h4 id="an-interpretable-active-learning-based-dialogue-labeling-application">An Interpretable Active-Learning Based Dialogue Labeling Application</h4>
<p>Type: research and software engineering</p>
<p>Creating a good dataset is one of the major pain points when investigating new venues in machine learning. One of the reasons for this is that labelling data is difficult and time-consuming, and software designed to ease that process is scarce and expensive. This project aims at producing an open source alternative to those solutions, where the designer of the experiment can configure a hosted personalised labelling software in a couple of hours. The application would then allow authorised users to log in a Web interface, and be presented with a sequence of random examples that they can label, which is where the research part of the project is. The goal of the project is to apply active learning and interpretable classification in order to produce an online software that allows people to label turn-by-turn dialogues with a generic set of classes.</p>
<h4 id="a-cross-lingual-approach-to-fake-news-classification">A Cross-Lingual Approach to Fake News Classification</h4>
<p>Type: research</p>
<p>In this project, you will investigate fake news classification in a new angle by asking the following fundamental question: can we use data in multiple languages to enhance the performance of a fake news classifier?</p>
