A reading list for the grad student (who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what to read) One thing I deeply regret about starting my graduate studies is the progressive loss of taste for casual reading. You feel trapped between wanting to read and the guilt of the reading material not being related to your work and end up associating the two, leading to simply not reading at all. Here is an attempt at a reading list of books about academia which I found useful, entertaining or something in between, while not being directly related to one&amp;rsquo;s research topic:</description>

      <description>About Me I did my PhD in the Robert Gordon University, with a SICSA Prize studentship to research argumentation stance mining in social media. I have been lucky to hold many different roles, from software engineering and data science positions in a tech startup in Edinburgh to several research and teaching contracts in the University of Toulouse, the Robert Gordon University, and the University of Nottingham. I have worked in many teams and with a multitude of people of different backgrounds: software engineers, computer scientists, petroleum geologists, education researchers, and many I am forgetting, which has given me a taste for interdisciplinary research.</description>

      <description>Databases, Interfaces (and Software design) Back to modules
Teaching team  Stuart Reeves Jeremie Clos  Core ideas of the module Understanding the architecture of web applications from data storage to presentation to the users.
In this module we focus on the structure of databases, including how to make them fast, efficient and reliable and on the ways of interacting with them via user interfaces. We examine the fundamentals of the relational database model, its mathematical basis, as well as implementations of the model in database management systems (DBMS) and languages to interact with them such as Structured Query Language (SQL).</description>

Fighting stillness: lifting weights for the busy academic Anybody who has met me knows that my main form of activity consists in the very simple sport of lifting weights (and putting them back down). There is an elegance in the simplicity of strength training that attracts me, and I have spent a long time trying to find a way to work that into my busy life as a graduate student and early career academic.</description>

      <description>Projects 1. Read this first If you contact me and it is obvious from your e-mail that you did not read this page, I will ignore your request.
Because 2020 was a dumpster fire of a year, and the world does not seem to be going in an upward direction, I am progressively shifting my focus to supervising projects for social good, i.e. projects which have a net positive or at least a net neutral ethical footprint.</description>

      <description>Ramblings and random thoughts The goal of this page is multiple: to act as a FAQ I can point my students to for specific issues, to serve as a general repository of resources that I cannot put anywhere else, and to store random thoughts I decide to put on (virtual) paper without any expectation that anybody will read them.

Sending e-mails and basic academic politeness Jeff Leek has an excellent blog post from 2011 on getting e-mails responses from busy people. While his recommendations are quite strict, they are a good idea of general guidelines university students should pick up when trying to communicate with most academics, who are almost always busy people. His rules are the following:
 RULE 1. Limit the number of e-mails you send to that person to one a day.</description>

      <description>Go back to ramblings
Writing often and badly One of the few things I have learned about myself when trying to write is that perfectionism can kill any sort of motivation one might have. But how does it do so? In my case, it does it by making me stop and thinking about the perfect sentences to put on paper. I got out of this vicious circle by applying two pieces of advice coming from two authors that could not be more different from each other:</description>
