      <description>About Me I did my PhD in the Robert Gordon University, with a SICSA Prize studentship to research argumentation stance mining in social media. I have been lucky to hold many different roles, from software engineering and data science positions in a tech startup in Edinburgh to several research and teaching contracts in the University of Toulouse, the Robert Gordon University, and the University of Nottingham. I have worked in many teams and with a multitude of people of different backgrounds: software engineers, computer scientists, petroleum geologists, education researchers, and many I am forgetting, which has given me a taste for interdisciplinary research.</description>

      <description>E-mail  Personal: name.surname@gmail.com Professional: name.surname@nottingham.ac.uk  If you are a student, I would encourage you to read this small guide to e-mail communication before contacting me. It can change based on circumstances, but my general policy is the following:
 I do not e-mail or read e-mails during the week-end. I do not e-mail or read e-mails before 9 AM and after 6 PM. I typically check my e-mails at regular, pre-planned intervals.</description>

      <description>Databases, Interfaces (and Software design) Back to modules
Teaching team  Stuart Reeves Jeremie Clos  Core ideas of the module Understanding the architecture of web applications from data storage to presentation to the users.
In this module we focus on the structure of databases, including how to make them fast, efficient and reliable and on the ways of interacting with them via user interfaces. We examine the fundamentals of the relational database model, its mathematical basis, as well as implementations of the model in database management systems (DBMS) and languages to interact with them such as Structured Query Language (SQL).</description>

      <description>Sending e-mails and basic academic politeness Jeff Leek had an excellent blog post from 2011 on getting e-mails responses from busy people, which seems to have disappeared recently. While his recommendations are quite strict, they are a good idea of general guidelines university students should pick up when trying to communicate with most academics, who are almost always busy people. Here is my expanded version of those rules:
