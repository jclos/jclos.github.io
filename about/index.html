    <h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>I did my PhD in the Robert Gordon University, with a SICSA Prize studentship to research argumentation stance mining in social media. I have been lucky to hold many different roles, from software engineering and data science positions in a tech startup in Edinburgh to several research and teaching contracts in the University of Toulouse, the Robert Gordon University, and the University of Nottingham. I have worked in many teams and with a multitude of people of different backgrounds: software engineers, computer scientists, petroleum geologists, education researchers, and many I am forgetting, which has given me a taste for interdisciplinary research. If you share this taste and are looking for a collaboration, feel free to get in touch with me.</p>

<h3 id="phd-thesis">PhD Thesis</h3>
<p>Robert Gordon University (Aberdeen, Scotland)</p>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: Representation and Learning Schemes for Argumentation Mining</p>
<p><strong>Team</strong>: Prof. Nirmalie Wiratunga, Dr. Stewart Massie, Prof. Joemon Jose, Dr. Guillaume Cabanac</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: This project focuses on the study of representation and learning schemes for argumentation stance mining from social media content, in order to enable fine-grained debate analysis. Funding for this research was provided by a SICSA prize studentship in the themes of Next Generation Internet and Modelling and Abstraction. I particularly focus on the use of a shallow computational graph for stance lexicon extraction.</p>
<h3 id="masters-thesis">Masters Thesis</h3>
<p>University of Toulouse (Toulouse, France)</p>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: Predicting Entry Points in Q&amp;A Systems</p>
<p><strong>Team</strong>: Dr. Guillaume Cabanac, Prof. Mohand Boughanem, Dr. Henri Prade</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: This work is an investigation in engineering features to enhance entry point prediction in Q&amp;A systems. We focus on modelling answer complexity using compression ratios. This research was done in the information retrieval team of the University of Toulouse computer science research laboratory (IRIT).</p>

<p>Contrary to some rumors going around the labs, I am actually not an android that is unplugged and put in the back of a room every evening. My common leisurely activities include lifting weights, cooking, reading, and playing video-games.</p>
