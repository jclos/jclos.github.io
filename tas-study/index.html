			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>
			The International Perspectives on Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (shortened to <abbr title="International Perspectives On Trustworthy Autonomous Systems">IPOTAS</abbr>) study is a year long study conducted by <strong>Dr Pepita Barnard</strong> and <strong>Dr Jeremie Clos</strong> on the influence of local, national, institutional and professional values and understanding of industry practitioners and academics on AI development and education. The study is supported by the <a href="https://www.tas.ac.uk/">Trustworthy Autonomous Systems hub</a>, a UK-wide research initiative created to research and advance trustworthiness in artificial intelligence and automated decision-making systems. As part of this study, we are travelling to academic and industry labs to conduct workshops using Moral IT cards and establish collaborations on joint topics of interest.</p>
			
			<p>
			Our goal is two-fold: 
			<ol>
				<li>Research approaches, challenges, and opportunities to trustworthy autonomous systems (e.g., human-centred/responsible/explainable/interpretable AI, Human-AI Interaction, Natural Language Processing etc.) in an academic and industrial context, with the dual objective of (1) building a survey study and (2) designing a workshop for the CHI 2023 conference to push a global research agenda.</li>
				<li>Discuss educational efforts on teaching curriculum development by identifying core topics and activities that reflect the multidisciplinary needs of the current and future <abbr title="Trustworthy Autonomous Systems">TAS</abbr> researchers and engineers.</li>
			</ol>

			  <p>As part of the TAS hub, our focus long-term is to establish strategic partnerships for the purpose of studying trust and trustworthiness as they relate to autonomous systems, through the redaction of joint papers, the hosting of joint workshops, and other research activities. 
				The objective of our visits are therefore to lay the foundations of such partnership through the production of a survey on attitudes and perspectives towards trustworthy autonomous systems-related issues and challenges from universities and institutions across the world. 
				As such, we are planning to use the Moral IT cards - a tool developed in the Horizon research centre to guide structured discussions about computer ethics. <a href="https://lachlansresearch.com/the-moral-it-legal-it-decks/">Moral IT cards</a> can help facilitate discussion around the broad themes of trust, trustworthiness and how they may be achieved from both a social and a technical perspective.</p>

				<p><strong>Pepita</strong> has a background in healthcare provision, clinical informatics and health services research. I am a human factors research fellow at Horizon Digital Economy Research Institute, School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham. In our cobot maker space, my AI projects involve humans with cobots, telepresence robots, other intelligent agents and devices for industrial and domestic settings. </p>

				<p><strong>Jeremie</strong> has a background in traditional computer science, information retrieval and machine learning. He is a research fellow in natural language processing in the TAS and a teaching associate in the School of Computer Science working on curriculum development for human-centred AI modules.
