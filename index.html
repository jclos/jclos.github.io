<p>I am an Assistant Professor in the University of Nottingham with a secondment in the <a href="https://www.tas.ac.uk/">Trustworthy Autonomous Systems research hub</a>. Some of my previous work was on the <a href="https://h2020enliven.org/">ENLIVEN project</a> as well as various smaller projects when the opportunity arose. This site serves as a point of contact to find me.</p>
<p>Throughout my admittely short career I have had the chance to work in several teams and interact with people of many backgrounds: software engineers, computer scientists, petroleum geologists, education researchers, linguists, and many I am forgetting. This has given me a strong taste for interdisciplinary, collaborative research. If you share this taste and are looking for a collaboration, feel free to <a href="https://jclos.github.io/contact/">get in touch with me</a>. That is the case whether you are an academic looking for a collaboration or an industry professional - I do not discriminate.</p>
<h1 id="research">Research</h1>
<p>My scientific interests revolve around applied interdisciplinary research involving machine learning. I am particularly interested and open to collaborative work in the following topics: <strong>interpretable machine learning</strong>, <strong>digital humanities</strong> (argument mining, social media mining, disinformation detection), and <strong>digital health</strong> (physiological data, mental health). I am currently involved in multiple projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://c19comms.wp.horizon.ac.uk/">Coronavirus Discourses</a>, a corpus linguistics-focused AHRC-funded project.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.tas.ac.uk/safespacesnlp/">SafeSpacesNLP</a>, a TAS-funded project on online content moderation.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.institutemh.org.uk/research/projects-and-studies/current-studies/tripod">TRIPOD</a>, a project focused on modernising therapeutic practice using natural language processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>From September 2022 to 2023, I will be co-leading the TAS-funded PIPO project investigating Privacy-Preserving techniques for Misinformation Monitoring.</p>
<p>I also have a long-standing collaboration with the <a href="https://brain-data-uon.gitlab.io/">Brain Data Group</a> through joint work with <a href="https://hanbnrd.gitlab.io/">Johann Benerradi</a>. I am currently co-supervising the following PhD students:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Johann Benerradi</strong> (started in 2019) who is investigating the use of fNIRS for mental workload classification.</li>
<li><strong>Dan Heaton</strong> (started in 2020) who is investigating the use of hybrid approaches to investigate public discourse around automated decision-making algorithms.</li>
<li><strong>Giovanni Schiazza</strong> (started in 2020) who is investigating the use of political internet memes and their effects on users.</li>
<li><strong>Xin Yu Liew</strong> (started in 2021) whose research focuses on human-in-the-loop approaches to misinformation detection in social media.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="teaching">Teaching</h1>
<p>I am currently lecturing in the University of Nottingham. The <a href="https://jclos.github.io/teaching/">teaching page</a> contains additional pages to centralise resources for the modules in which I intervene.</p>

<h2 id="about-letters-of-recommendation">About letters of recommendation</h2>
<p>I have a bad case of the referral fatigue so I <strong>will</strong> look for any excuse to avoid writing them. Here are a few tips you can use to trick me into writing them:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Politely ask for them</u>. If I receive a request from a university about an application I never heard about before, I will ignore it and you will look bad.</li>
<li><u>Don&rsquo;t ask for too many of them</u>. I take pride in my work, whether it is teaching or research, so letters of recommendation take time. Show me that you respect my time by asking for a couple of references instead of bombarding my name on a dozen of them.</li>
<li><u>Make sure that I know you</u>. Me teaching a module is not enough, even if you got a good grade (a good grade is not indicative that you will be fit for a Masters or a PhD). Sending me your previous transcripts from high school is also not very convincing.</li>
<li><u>Show me that you know me</u>. If you are asking me to write a reference letter for an engineering school, I will know that you have not even spent a minute researching what I do and what I am qualified to comment on. If you can&rsquo;t do that little amount of research, how can I recommend you for something as significant as a postgraduate degree?</li>
