<p>I am concurrently a Teaching Associate and a Research Fellow in the University of Nottingham branch of the <a href="https://www.tas.ac.uk/">Trustworthy Autonomous Systems research hub</a>, previously working in the <a href="https://h2020enliven.org/">ENLIVEN European project</a>. As much as I dream that it would mean a 50%/50% workload split, it typically means that I end up with a 200% workload. This page serves as a point of contact to find me.</p>
<p>I did my PhD in the Robert Gordon University, with a SICSA Prize studentship to research argumentation stance mining in social media. I have been lucky to hold many different roles, from software engineering and data science positions in a tech startup in Edinburgh to several research and teaching contracts in the University of Toulouse, the Robert Gordon University, and the University of Nottingham. I have worked in many teams and with a multitude of people of different backgrounds: software engineers, computer scientists, petroleum geologists, education researchers, and many I am forgetting, which has given me a taste for interdisciplinary research. If you share this taste and are looking for a collaboration, feel free to get in touch with me.</p>
<h1 id="research-interest">Research Interest</h1>
<p>My scientific interests revolve around applied interdisciplinary research involving machine learning at its core. I am particularly interested and open to collaborative work in the following topics: <strong>interpretable machine learning</strong>, <strong>digital humanities</strong> (argument mining, social media mining), and <strong>digital health</strong> (physiological data, mental health). I am currently involved in the <a href="https://c19comms.wp.horizon.ac.uk/">Coronavirus Discourses project</a>, as well as other TAS Hub projects on public sentiment towards autonomous systems and moderation of public discourse.</p>
<h1 id="teaching">Teaching</h1>
<p>I am currently teaching in the University of Nottingham. The <a href="https://jclos.github.io/teaching/">teaching page</a> contains additional pages to centralise resources for those modules.</p>

<h2 id="about-letters-of-recommendation">About letters of recommendation</h2>
<p>I have a bad case of the referral fatigue so I <strong>will</strong> look for any excuse to avoid writing them. You can easily trick me into writing them for you by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Politely ask for them</u>. If I receive a request from a university about an application I never heard about before, I will ignore it and you will look bad.</li>
<li><u>Don&rsquo;t ask for too many of them</u>. I take pride in my work, whether it is teaching or research, so letters of recommendation take time. Show me that you respect my time by asking for a couple of references instead of bombarding my name on a dozen of them.</li>
<li><u>Make sure that I know you</u>. Me teaching a module is not enough, even if you got a good grade (a good grade is not indicative that you will be fit for a Masters or a PhD). Sending me your previous transcripts from high school is also not very convincing.</li>
<li><u>Show me that you know me</u>. If you are asking me to write a reference letter for an engineering school, I will know that you have not even spent a minute researching what I do and what I am qualified to comment on. If you can&rsquo;t do that little amount of research, how can I recommend you for something as significant as a postgraduate degree?</li>
