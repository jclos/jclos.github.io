			<h1>What to expect</h1>
			<p class="noindent">The following project ideas are separated in multiple categories. <strong>Engineering</strong> projects focus on producing high quality software, and they will be judged according to the following rules of thumb: would someone hire me if I showed them that software? Would someone purchase this software? <strong>Research</strong> projects focus on designing, developing and running an experiment, and then extracting empirical knowledge from it. They are judged based on the following rules of thumb: could this be published in a conference or a scientific journal, and how much would be needed to make it so?</p>
			<h1>What do you need to do?</h1>
			<p class="noindent">I put a lot of time and effort in supervising student projects and I expect you to match that effort, therefore the first thing you should do is ask yourself whether you really want to do that specific project or whether you are just choosing it because you are out of ideas. If you are still motivated by the idea, then you should contact me and tell me which project interests you and why, and your ideas of what it could entail, and why you think you can do a good job at it. I do not expect you to spit out a half finished project and have an appropriate CV, but a lot of those projects can only be done justice if you have some prior exposure to their topics, whether it is something you did on your own (or via some MOOC), or something you did in your university.
			</p><p>
			If you are looking into potentially pursuing a research postgraduate degree (MRes, PhD) I would highly recommend discussing it with me. Some of those projects could easily end up in research papers and having research papers to your name is very good for your application to a graduate school.

			<h1>Research projects</h1>
        
			<h4>Enhancing Fake News Classification using Data Augmentation</h4>
			<strong>Keywords</strong>: <a class="tag">Fake News Detection</a> <a class="tag">Data Augmentation</a>
			<p class="noindent">One of the challenges in Fake News Detection is the rarity of good labelled data. In this project you will evaluate a set of data augmentation approaches to enhance a fake news classifier with training data.</p>
			<hr class="subsection" />
			<h4>A Cross-Lingual Approach to Fake News Classification</h4>
			<strong>Keywords</strong>: <a class="tag">Fake News Detection</a>
			<p class="noindent">In this project, you will investigate fake news classification in a new angle by asking the following fundamental question: can we use data in multiple languages to enhance the performance of a fake news classifier?</p>
			<hr class="subsection" />
			<h4>Social Feedback-Enhanced Argument Claim Extraction from News Headlines</h4>
			<strong>Keywords</strong>: <a class="tag">Argument Mining</a> <a class="tag">Social Media Mining</a>
			<p class="noindent">In this project you will build a system that leverages social feedback from Twitter and Reddit threads to extract arguments from news headlines and measure how socially accepted they are in specific communities.</p>
			<hr class="subsection" />
			<h4>Finding Controversial Topics using a Distant-Labelled Dataset</h4>
			<strong>Keywords</strong>: <a class="tag">Controversy Detection</a> <a class="tag">Social Media Mining</a>
			<p class="noindent"><b>[Taken by a student. If you are interested get in touch and we can work on designing a variation of it]</b></p>
			<p class="noindent">In this project, you will mine user generated comments in controversial topics (e.g. politics) in order to perform an analysis of the linguistic and contextual features that can help predict the controversiality of a comment. Optionally, you will then build a small web application to help users know that they are about to post controversial content and provide them with an explanation as to why. </p>
			<hr class="subsection" />
			<h4>Few-Shot Task Classification from Physiological Data</h4>
			<strong>Keywords</strong>: <a class="tag">Few Shot Learning</a> <a class="tag">Brain Computing</a>
			<p class="noindent">In this project, you will produce a comparative analysis of a set of few-shot learning approaches to detect what a user is doing from their brain data. Because we don't like easy things, we will attempt to do so with only one example of each task.</p>

			<h1>Engineering projects</h1>
			
			<h4>A Semi-Automated Fact-Checking Tool for Online News</h4>
			<strong>Keywords</strong>: <a class="tag">Fake News Detection</a> <a class="tag">Online News</a> <a class="tag">Web Programming</a>
			<p class="noindent">Build a plug-in for Google Chrome which let us label and annotate news articles with evidence of their veracity, or lack thereof.</p>
			<hr class="subsection" />
			
			<h4>An Explanation-Based Recipe Recommender System</h4>
			<strong>Keywords</strong>: <a class="tag">Recommender Systems</a> <a class="tag">Information Retrieval</a> <a class="tag">Web Programming</a>
			<p class="noindent">In this project you will build a full-fledged recommender system based on a large scale collection of recipes. When returning recommendations, the system will provide an explanation for each of the results (e.g., "result 1 was returned because it has a lower sugar content"). Users will be able to pick a recipe and provide an explanation of what guided their choice (e.g., "the picture looked more appealing"). The recommender system will take that feedback into account to improve its recommendations.</p>		
			<hr class="subsection" />
			
			<h4>A Storage and Annotation Engine for Researchers</h4>
			<strong>Keywords</strong>: <a class="tag">Information Retrieval</a> <a class="tag">Research</a> <a class="tag">Web Programming</a>
			<p class="noindent">You will use the CORE API (https://core.ac.uk/services/api/) in order to build a search engine client that lets the user annotate articles and create a personal database. The search engine client will let the user add a paper to their personal collection, which will download them into an offline document collection where the paper will be indexed, along with their annotation, for further use. </p>
			<hr class="subsection" />
			
			<h4>A Personalised Plot Generator</h4>
			<strong>Keywords</strong>: <a class="tag">Machine Learning</a> <a class="tag">Computational Creativity</a> <a class="tag">Web Programming</a>
			<p class="noindent">In this project you will build a system that generates a movie plot based on specific personal features of the user. The user will then receive a set of candidate plots and be able to mark them up or down, based on a specific set of criteria (whether they like it, whether it makes sense, whether it has too many grammatical mistakes). The system will then use that feedback to generate new movie plots. The system will then be enhanced to allow for cross-user recommendation, by providing a user with plots from other users in order to build a collaborative filtering profile, and use that collective information to write better plots.</p>
			<hr class="subsection" />
		
			<h4>An Active-Learning Based Labeling Application</h4>
			<strong>Keywords</strong>: <a class="tag">Machine Learning</a> <a class="tag">Active Learning</a> <a class="tag">Web Programming</a>
			<p class="noindent"><b>[Taken by a student. If you are interested get in touch and we can work on designing a variation of it]</b></p>
			<p class="noindent">Creating a good dataset is one of the major pain points when investigating new venues in machine learning. One of the reasons for this is that labelling data is difficult and time-consuming, and software designed to ease that process is scarce and expensive. This project aims at producing an open source alternative to those solutions, where the designer of the experiment can configure a hosted personalised labelling software in a couple of hours. The application would then allow authorised users to log in a Web interface, and be presented with a sequence of random examples that they can label, which is where the research part of the project is. One of the goals of the project is to investigate and develop a set of ordering heuristics that let the system know which instance to present to the user for labelling. This can depend on intrinsic features of the data (text, image, audio) or features derived from more complex models (e.g. distance from separating hyperplane).</p>
