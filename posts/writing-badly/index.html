<h3 id="writing-often-and-badly">Writing often and badly</h3>
<p>One of the few things I have learned about myself when trying to write is that perfectionism can kill any sort of motivation one might have. But how does it do so? In my case, it does it by making me stop and thinking about the perfect sentences to put on paper. I got out of this vicious circle by applying two pieces of advice coming from two authors that could not be more different from each other:</p>
<h4 id="advice-1-write-badly">Advice 1: WRITE BADLY</h4>
<p>This came from Harmontown, Dan Harmon&rsquo;s podcast. Harmon has been a prolific writer and creator of the Community tv show and co-creator of the Rick and Morty cartoon. Perfectionism often comes from a good intention: you want to be a good writer. But you can&rsquo;t become a good writer until you actually do some writing, which you can&rsquo;t do because you want to be a good writer and good writing does not simply come from thinking harder, it comes from experience. One way Dan advised to go around this problem is by aiming to do the exact opposite: &ldquo;write to prove yourself how bad of a writer you are&rdquo;. By doing so, it is a lot easier to put content on page, and you end doing some actual writing. You can then spend some time fixing it into something good, and with time your &ldquo;worst&rdquo; becomes better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good advice.</p>
<h4 id="advice-2-write-often-to-avoid-pressure">Advice 2: Write often to avoid pressure</h4>
<p>Another source of blank page syndrome is simply the stress of having to write. The advice, which I got from reading Joli Jensen&rsquo;s Write No Matter What, is simply to write more often. Write anything. Put some words on a paper you are working through. Write some pseudo-blog post about advices about writing (oops!). It does not matter as much as simply writing and getting in the habit of putting thoughts into words. Much like you wouldn&rsquo;t start running by doing a marathon, or you wouldn&rsquo;t start strength training by trying to bench press a car, you shouldn&rsquo;t start writing by opening a blank page and aiming to finish an entire journal paper or thesis. Instead, you would do a lot of low pressure running/training (resp. low pressure writing) every day/week to build you up until it feels a lot more natural.</p>
<p>Once again, it&rsquo;s good advice (and a good book).</p>
