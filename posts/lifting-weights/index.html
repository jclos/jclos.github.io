<h3 id="fighting-stillness-lifting-weights-for-the-busy-academic">Fighting stillness: lifting weights for the busy academic</h3>
<p>Anybody who has met me knows that my main form of activity consists in the very simple sport of lifting weights (and putting them back down). There is an elegance in the simplicity of strength training that attracts me, and I have spent a long time trying to find a way to work that into my busy life as a graduate student and early career academic. I write down some basic principles that I have learned so that they can maybe someday be useful to someone else. A lot of all this is not cited because this is not a paper and I don&rsquo;t really care that much about its rigour.</p>
<h4 id="principle-1-doing-the-wrong-thing-with-intent-will-always-be-better-than-the-constant-search-for-optimal-training">Principle 1: Doing the wrong thing with intent will always be better than the constant search for optimal training</h4>
<p>The pitfall that all scientifically minded people fall into when getting into lifting is trying to find the optimal thing to do. What is the best exercise to do X? What angle should I lift Y? What is the exact amount of protein I need to put in my body? How long should I wait? 10 reps or 12 reps?</p>
<p>Nothing could matter less. Go to the gym. Lift some weight for some reps then rest for a bit and do it again. Then go home, have a nice meal and go to bed. The energy wasted in optimising could be spent in the gym or in recovery and yield more results than endless spreadsheets and calculations. Forget all this and channel your inner caveman.</p>
<h4 id="principle-2-you-dont-need-as-much-as-you-think">Principle 2: You don&rsquo;t need as much as you think</h4>
<p>It takes surprisingly little work to build muscle/strength if you are starting, and to maintain it if you are an intermediate lifter. I am talking about something like 45-60 minutes 2 to 3 times a week for an intermediate lifter to maintain their strength, provided adequate diet and rest. That would be the equivalent of roughly 20 to 30 minutes per day if you really split it completely - but that does not account for travelling to the gym, changing, etc. For most people, unless you are a well-trained lifter, 8 to 12 sets per week on each basic movement, taken around 2 to 3 reps from technical failure (so if you can do 12 reps, stop at 10), is enough to maintain muscle.</p>
<h4 id="principle-3-you-are-not-as-fragile-as-you-think">Principle 3: You are not as fragile as you think</h4>
<p>Don&rsquo;t freak out if something hurts a little bit more than usual. You didn&rsquo;t snap anything. You will be fine. Your body is not made of porcelain. The good doctors of Barbell Medicine have an excellent article on <a href="https://www.barbellmedicine.com/blog/catastrophizing/">Fear, Catastrophising and Training</a> which should be a must-read for anybody who has any sort of pain.</p>
<h4 id="principle-4-basic-movements-and-where-to-find-them">Principle 4: Basic movements and where to find them</h4>
<p>To get into the meat of it, you can get away with just covering a few basic movements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Horizontal pushing (e.g., barbell bench press)</li>
<li>Horizontal pulling (e.g., barbell row)</li>
<li>Vertical pushing (e.g., overhead shoulder press)</li>
<li>Vertical pulling (e.g., chin ups)</li>
<li>Hip hinge (e.g., Romanian deadlift)</li>
<li>Squat (e.g., barbell back squat)</li>
</ul>
<p>For pure health reasons, what matters is doing these movements. The actual lift does not matter. You want to do leg press instead of barbell squats? Have fun. You want to do machine chest press instead of barbell bench press? Do it. You want to add some dumbbell curls because your arms are tiny? Do some curls.</p>
<h4 id="principle-5-you-dont-need-to-rest-as-much-as-you-think">Principle 5: You don&rsquo;t need to rest as much as you think</h4>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to wait a week to retrain the same muscle - a day or two of gap is enough. You don&rsquo;t need to wait 10 minutes between sets because you feel tired, 1-3 minutes is enough for most people.</p>
<h4 id="principle-6-avoid-disappointment-by-prescribing-less">Principle 6: Avoid disappointment by prescribing less</h4>
<p>You arrive home, tired from a long day at the lab. It&rsquo;s Tuesday, time to go train. You look at your training sheet and that&rsquo;s when you see it, a 90 minute session programmed completely from warm-up to cooldown. For some people that&rsquo;s pure motivation right here but I&rsquo;d be willing to bet that for a larger part of the population it&rsquo;s a motivation killer. You can already envision you being exhausted 30 minutes in and dragging your feet through the remaining of the session.</p>
<p>An alternative which I much prefer is to prescribe only the minimum needed. I get home, look at my training log and see that I am due to go and perform 4 sets of barbell squat, 6 sets of barbell overhead press, and 4 sets of chin ups, which should take me a grand total of 30 minutes. When I do get there I of course tend to do a little (or a lot) more but at least I go knowing that I could get all of it done in half an hour and feel good about myself if I wanted to. The option is still there. By only prescribing the worst case scenario my motivation is left intact and on bad days I still do something.</p>
<h4 id="principle-7-a-basic-template">Principle 7: A basic template</h4>
<p>Academic life is busy and full of surprises, and therefore having the most flexible template is usually a key to maintaining motivation. Here is the training template (alternating session A and B, with one or more day of rest in between) I use when I am extremely busy in order to maintain my meagre strength (pre-pandemic 200kg squat, 140kg bench press, 220kg deadlift, 100kg overhead press):</p>
<p>Day A:</p>
<ul>
<li>Squat: work up to a heavy set of 8, then repeat for 3 sets of 6 repetitions, do as many repetitions as possible on the last set</li>
<li>Overhead shoulder press: work up to a heavy set of 6, then repeat for 4 sets of 4 repetitions, do as many repetitions as possible on the last set</li>
<li>Romanian deadlift: work up to a heavy set of 10, then repeat for 3 sets of 8 repetitions</li>
<li>Chin ups: 30 repetitions in total, done in as few sets as possible</li>
<li>Dips: 20 repetitions in total, done in as few sets as possible</li>
</ul>
<p>Day B:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deadlift: work up to a heavy set of 6, then repeat for 3 sets of 4 repetitions, do as many repetitions as possible on the last set</li>
<li>Barbell bench press: work up to a heavy set of 6, then repeat for 6 sets of 4 repetitions, do as many repetitions as possible on the last set</li>
<li>Squat: work up to a heavy set of 10, then repeat for 3 sets of 8 repetitions</li>
<li>Dips: 30 repetitions in total, done in as few sets as possible</li>
<li>Pull ups: 20 repetitions in total, done in as few sets as possible</li>
</ul>
