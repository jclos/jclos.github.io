<h3 id="sending-e-mails-and-basic-academic-politeness">Sending e-mails and basic academic politeness</h3>
<p>Jeff Leek has <a href="https://simplystatistics.org/2011/09/23/getting-email-responses-from-busy-people/">an excellent blog post from 2011 on getting e-mails responses from busy people</a>. While his recommendations are quite strict, they are a good idea of general guidelines university students should pick up when trying to communicate with most academics, who are almost always busy people. His rules are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RULE 1.</strong> Limit the number of e-mails you send to that person to one a day. This is obviously a soft rule - and if you worked with someone on multiple projects, and you needed to update them on both, then sending one e-mail per project makes complete sense.</li>
<li><strong>RULE 2.</strong> Limit the size of the e-mails to at most 3 sentences (preferably shorter). While this might sound extreme, 3 sentences can convey a lot, and that&rsquo;s not counting the standard greetings. There is a difference between short and curt.</li>
<li><strong>RULE 3.</strong> Limit the format of questions to a yes/no answer. More generally, it&rsquo;s more about limiting the set of responses. It could be yes/no or it could be something else. You want to pre-chew as much of the work as possible so that you can get a swift answer. Think about what kind of feedback you really need - it takes me about a minute to read a piece of text and answer <em>good</em>/<em>needs improvement</em>/<em>needs major rewriting</em>, but it takes me multiple hours to produce a nuanced response. And I do not have multiple hours. Therefore you are left with the choice between a simple response today or a nuanced one next week (at least!).</li>
<li><strong>RULE 4.</strong> In case of time sensitive issues, state a default action and a date/time at which you will take that action unless advised otherwise. For example, &ldquo;I will fix the grammar and send the report as is on Monday at 8 AM unless there is an issue&rdquo;. Make sure to use reasonable deadlines and some common sense here to not appear rude.</li>
<li><strong>RULE 5.</strong> Be as specific as possible in your requests (without going over in length). More specifically, don&rsquo;t email someone to ask them if you can e-mail them to ask a question. Just e-mail the question. A consequence of this rule: drop the obsequious noise, and state what you want clearly and simply. Don&rsquo;t write &ldquo;I was wondering if you might be ok allowing me the opportunity to ask you a question about&hellip;&rdquo; - just write the question itself.</li>
<li><strong>RULE 6.</strong> Make sure your e-mail contains keywords that make it easy to search for them later. Most e-mail software is terrible - make sure your e-mail does not get lost by making its life easier.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="basic-politeness-and-standard-greetings">Basic politeness and standard greetings</h4>
<p>Now that this is said, the second thing is basic politeness. It&rsquo;s a cultural feature so different rules might apply in different places, but while there are many correct ways of addressing academic staff as a student (some people prefer first name, some people prefer Dr. Lastname, some people prefer Professor, etc.) there are definitely incorrect ways of doing it.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Dr. Firstname&rdquo; makes it sound like you are addressing a TV personality.</li>
<li>Nicknames, unless the lecturer has told you that&rsquo;s what they go by.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Dude&rdquo;/&ldquo;bro&rdquo; (actually seen in e-mails) is probably not a good idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>That also means that you need to add some standard greetings in your e-mail. Just because you have to be short does not mean you can be rude. People who have e-mailed me know that I use the same e-mail structure and greetings in all cases and occasions:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Dear X,
&gt; (e-mail content)
&gt; Kind regards,
&gt; Jeremie
</code></pre>
<p>No need to be grandiloquent. Simple, basic and respectful greetings get the job done, don&rsquo;t waste time and space, and work in most cases.</p>
