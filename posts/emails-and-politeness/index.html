<h3 id="sending-e-mails-and-basic-academic-politeness">Sending e-mails and basic academic politeness</h3>
<p>Jeff Leek has <a href="https://simplystatistics.org/2011/09/23/getting-email-responses-from-busy-people/">an excellent blog post from 2011 on getting e-mails responses from busy people</a>. While his recommendations are quite strict, they are a good idea of general guidelines university students should pick up when trying to communicate with most academics, who are almost always busy people. His rules are the following:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Limit the number of e-mails you send to that person to one a day.</li>
 <li>Limit the size of the e-mails to at most 3 sentences. Preferably shorter. I think this is extreme, but if you start thinking about paragraphs your e-mail is simply too long. </li>
 <li>Limit the format of questions to a yes/no answer. More generally, I think it's more about limiting the set of responses. It could be yes/no or it could be something else. You have to weigh in what kind of feedback you really need - it takes me about a minute to read a piece of text and answer good/needs improvement/needs major rewriting, but it takes me multiple hours to produce a nuanced response. I do not have multiple hours, so you need to decide whether you want a simple response today or a nuanced one next week. </li>
 <li>In case of time sensitive issues, state a default action and a date/time at which you will take that action unless advised otherwise. For example, "I will fix the grammar and send the report as is on Monday at 8 AM unless there is an issue".</li>
 <li>Be as specific as possible in your requests without going over in length. More specifically, don't email someone to ask them if you can e-mail them to ask a question. Just e-mail the question. </li>
 <li>Make sure your e-mail contains keywords that make it easy to search for them later. Most e-mail software is terrible - make sure your e-mail does not get lost by making its life easier.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="basic-politeness">Basic politeness</h4>
<p>Now that this is said, the second thing is basic politeness. It&rsquo;s a cultural feature so different rules might apply in different places, but while there are many correct ways of addressing academic staff as a student (some people prefer first name, some people prefer Dr. Lastname, some people prefer Professor, etc.) there are definitely incorrect ways of doing it.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Dr. Firstname&rdquo; makes it sound like you are addressing a TV personality.</li>
<li>Nicknames, unless the lecturer has told you that&rsquo;s what they go by.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Dude&rdquo;/&ldquo;bro&rdquo; (actually seen in e-mails) is probably not a good idea.</li>
</ul>
