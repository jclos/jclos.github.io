<h3 id="a-reading-list-for-the-grad-student-who-doesnt-know-what-to-read">A reading list for the grad student (who doesn&rsquo;t know what to read)</h3>
<p>One thing I deeply regret about starting my graduate studies is the progressive loss of taste for casual reading. You feel trapped between wanting to read and the guilt of the reading material not being related to your work and end up associating the two, leading to simply not reading at all. Here is an attempt at a reading list of books about academia which I found useful, entertaining or something in between, while not being directly related to one&rsquo;s research topic:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Academia Obscura: The Hidden Silly Side of Higher Education</strong> is a funny and informative book about the less serious side of academia. Reading it helped me contextualise my troubles as a grad student and realise that the entire field was, in fact, rather silly.</li>
<li><strong>The Scientistâ€™s Guide to Writing: How to Write More Easily and Effectively throughout Your Scientific Career</strong> is a dry read, but an important one. I still use it as a reference to teach writing to my Masters students.</li>
<li><strong>The Slow Professor: Challenging the Culture of Speed in the Academy</strong> is a nice read about academic culture in a world where more and more time is wasted on trying to find metrics to measure everything.</li>
<li><strong>A PhD Is Not Enough!: A Guide to Survival in Science</strong> should be essential reading, and I wish I had read it before starting my PhD. It deals with a lot of intricate details about the academic job market and how to use one&rsquo;s time effectively while pursuing graduate studies.</li>
<li><strong>Stylish Academic Writing</strong> is, as its name indicates, a plea to academics to stop writing such boring and formulaic papers. It is best read after The Scientist&rsquo;s Guide to Writing and once you have written a few papers of your own, because you can only break the rules once you really know them.</li>
<li><strong>The Productive Researcher</strong> is an interesting book about the habits of high-performing researchers. Of course, it is difficult to know whether those researchers became high-performing because of these habits, despite of these habits, or whether they developed these habits because their high performance could afford them to, but it is full of interesting insights into research, which is an activity that is usually done in isolation in our ivory towers.</li>
<li><strong>Write No Matter What</strong> is also an excellent book about, you guessed it, writing. It provides actionable advice that one should pick and choose from and add in their toolbox, and I wish I had read it before starting my graduate studies.</li>
</ul>
